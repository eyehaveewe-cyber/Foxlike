# Foxlike progress

## 2026-10-22 — First complete campaign

Implemented under Jonathan's request for a best-effort, one-shot Starfox-like game, with permission to draw from Project Barrel Roll. This repository was empty at the start.

### Delivered

1. Complete three-mission arcade campaign: Viridia coastal blockade, Aurora ice-field relay, Terminus carrier assault; launch, boss, results, retries, mission unlocks, ending and local saves.
2. Responsive 3D rail flight with keyboard/mouse/controller input, continuous twin lasers, target-lock missiles, nova bombs, boost/brake, invulnerable barrel rolls and wingman crossfire.
3. Nine procedural airframes with reactive banking/flaps, thruster animation, articulated/collapsing RIME arms, rotating boss cores, carrier bay doors, pooled debris and shockwaves.
4. Authored encounter timelines, enemy formation/sway patterns, bomber volleys, rescue waves, asteroid slalom, repair/upgrade/ordnance pickups, boss attack cycles and telegraphed carrier lance.
5. Original mission/boss music, synthesized effects, cockpit comms, mute/chatter controls, three difficulty settings, scores/chains and stage records.
6. Native Windows and single-threaded browser export presets, reproducible packaging, CI artifacts, integration tests and committed rendered evidence.

### Evidence and limits

Read `docs/VERIFICATION.md` for actual validation and build status. The integration suite has 49 assertions, including all mission completion paths. The exported Web build also passed 8 real Chromium input/lifecycle checks; CI now includes that regression gate. Automated playthroughs use invulnerability for route coverage and reduced boss health for deterministic completion. Human balance testing, physical gamepad testing and native Windows runtime testing remain separate work.

### Next useful work

Play one complete campaign on the user's Windows PC. Tune aim assistance, dodge readability and boss durability from that session. Then consider branching routes or an all-range encounter, a larger enemy roster, rebinding/accessibility options and voice dialogue. Keep substantial flight feel improvements ahead of cosmetic menu churn.
